title: Introduction to Quantum Computing and Quantum Hardware
tagline: An introduction to the world of quantum computing, with an exploration of some of the key quantum algorithms and their implementations, as well as the quantum hardware that is designed to run these algorithms. The course was first offered during the Qiskit Global Summer School in July 2020 as a two-week intensive summer school.

## Prerequisites
Minimal prerequisites are required for the Qiskit Global Summer School. If you know [how to multiply two matrices](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/x9e81a4f98389efdf:matrices/x9e81a4f98389efdf:multiplying-matrices-by-matrices/v/matrix-multiplication-intro), and have some programming experience in Python, you are ready for the Qiskit Global Summer School.

You can [brush up on Python programming](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-prerequisites/python-and-jupyter-notebooks.html) before attending the lectures by using the Qiskit Textbook. To make the most out of these lectures, you may also consider looking through the [linear algebra prerequisites](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-prerequisites/linear_algebra.html) section of the Qiskit Textbook.
